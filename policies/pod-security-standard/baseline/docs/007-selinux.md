# PSS-BASELINE-007: Selinux

Setting the SELinux type is restricted, and setting a custom SELinux user or role option is forbidden.

This policy provides a way to use the SELinux security module to restrict the actions of containers and helps ensure that containers operate in a secure and isolated environment.
