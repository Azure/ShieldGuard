# PSS-BASELINE-002: Privileged Containers

Privileged Pods disable most security mechanisms and must be disallowed.

This policy provides a way to run containers with elevated privileges and access to the host system, but also requires strict controls and monitoring to ensure that these containers do not pose a security threat.
